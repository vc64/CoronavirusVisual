# CoronavirusVisual
Animated graphs of Coronavirus infections and deaths for 4 states(MA, NY, CA, WA). Data obtained from JHU CSSE data repository on Github. Plot made using Plotly Python package. 

Code takes around a minute to run, will open html in browser when done. Browser usually fails to display it the first time so I recommend running it twice. Probably should have used javascript d3 for this.
