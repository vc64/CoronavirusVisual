# CoronavirusVisual
Animated graphs of Coronavirus infections and deaths for 4 states(MA, NY, CA, WA). Data obtained from JHU CSSE data repository on Github. Plots made using Plotly and Matplotlib. 

Code takes around a minute to run. The Plotly code will open an html file in the browser when it's done. For some reason, the browser usually fails to display it the first time so I recommend running it twice. The Matplotlib code generates a gif.
